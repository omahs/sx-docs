# Relayer

The relayer submit transactions received by the UI to StarkNet. It will include a mechanism that allow DAOs to fund the transactions sent by the relayer so that there is a zero cost for the user. However importantly, users can directly interact with Snapshot X and therefore do not rely on trusting the relayer to not censor votes. Anyone can run a relayer if they want to take over the sponsoring of transactions.
