# Overview

Snapshot X is designed to be as modular as possible to provide maximum configurability. As displayed in the diagram below, certain contracts have new instances which are deployed for each DAO (or more specifically per [space](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/sx-core#Space-Contract)) that use Snapshot X. Whilst others are treated like library contracts and have a single instance which is shared between all DAOs.
