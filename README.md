# Snapshot X

Welcome to Snapshot X's documentation! If you're looking to know more about Snapshot X, or looking for specific technical details about Snapshot X, you've come to the right place!

# What's Snapshot X?

Snapshot X is a voting tool for DAOs. Simple as that! Technically speaking, it's a set of highly modular smart-contracts that interact with each other to do all the book-keeping, but the end result is the same: it's a voting tool!

The difference between Snapshot X and [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org) is that Snapshot X is fully on-chain. What this means is:

- **Votes are permissionless**: No one can censor your vote!
- **Votes are trustless**: If you votes `Yes` on a proposal, you vote **will** be counted. You don't need to trust SnapshotLabs or any group of individuals; you can be sure your vote will be correctly handled.
