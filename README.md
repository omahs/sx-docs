# Snapshot X

Welcome to Snapshot X's documentation! If you're looking to know more about Snapshot X, or looking for specific technical details about Snapshot X, you've come to the right place!

# What's Snapshot X?

Snapshot X is a voting tool for DAOs. Simple as that! Technically speaking, it's a set of highly modular smart-contracts that interact with each other to do all the book-keeping, but the end result is the same: it's a voting tool!

The difference between Snapshot X and [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org) is that Snapshot X is fully on-chain. What this means is:

- **Votes are permissionless**: No one can censor your vote!
- **Votes are fair**: If you vote `Yes` on a proposal, your vote **will** be counted. You don't need to trust SnapshotLabs or any group of humans; you can be sure your vote will be correctly accounted for.
- **Execution is trustless**: Say you create a new proposal which, if it passes, will transfer 1ETH to `snapshot.eth`. If the proposal passes, the 1ETH will automatically get sent to `snapshot.eth`, without any further human help needed.

These are important properties for a voting system, as a voting system is meaningless if it can be rigged, or if it can censor votes!
